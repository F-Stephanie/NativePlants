                <span id="what_are_they_text">
                    As the name suggests, native plants are native to a specific region. This means they occur naturally in that particular region and have not been introduced by humans. Native plants evolved in the native region, so they are adapted to the local climate, soil, and wildlife. In turn, the local wildlife have also adapted to the native plants, and many rely on them for resources.

                    Native plants offer many benefits both to gardeners and the local wildlife.

                            </strong>
                            Native plants require less maintenance than exotic plants because they are adapted to the local environment. Native plants are used to the amount of rainfall, the temperature ranges, and the amount of sunlight. They can get maximum benefits from the soil because they involved in that soil. They can ward of pests like bugs, small animals, and even deer because they coevolved with those pests. Whereas exotic plants require the gardener to mimic their natural environment by watering them, fertilizing them, and using pesticides, native plants require lower levels of care [MOBOT ch4]. Native plants will also generally last much longer because they do not require as much care. If you have exotic plants in your garden, you can plant native plants with them to keep pests away, attract pollinators, and improve soil health.

                            </strong>
                            The native wildlife coevolved with native plants, meaning they are used to relying on native wildlife for resources and have evolved to maximize those benefits. For example, native pollinators and nectar-drinkers get maximum benefits from native flowers. Native insects and small animals can find shelter in native plants like prairie grasses. Native birds are adapted to native seeds, meaning their beaks can open the seeds and their bodies can use those nutrients efficiently. Additionally, the native plants have evolved with that wildlife, so they are able to provide without being harmed too bad in the process whereas exotic plants may be irreparably damaged when the wildlife tries to eat or use it.

                            There are so many beautiful native species. INCLUDE PICTURES. Native plants can also give a region a “sense of place,” which is a familiarity and connection with nature in a specific region [MOBOT ch4]. Frequently exposing oneself to the native plants species in a region helps them connect and feel a sense of belonging in that area, just how one’s hometown may have a type of food they are familiar with.
